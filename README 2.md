Kubeapps is a web-based UI for deploying and managing applications in Kubernetes clusters. Kubeapps allows you to:

- Browse and deploy [Helm](https://github.com/helm/helm) charts from chart repositories
- Inspect, upgrade and delete Helm-based applications installed in the cluster
- Add custom and [private chart repositories](docs/user/private-app-repository.md) (supports [ChartMuseum](https://github.com/helm/chartmuseum) and [JFrog Artifactory](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/Helm+Chart+Repositories))
- Browse and provision external services from the [Service Catalog](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/service-catalog) and available Service Brokers
- Connect Helm-based applications to external services with Service Catalog Bindings
- Secure authentication and authorization based on Kubernetes [Role-Based Access Control](docs/user/access-control.md)

## Quick Start

Use the Helm chart to install the latest version of Kubeapps: 

***Note:*** Kubeapps supports both Helm 2 and Helm 3. For detailed instructions on how to install and use Kubeapps follow the [Getting Started Guide](docs/user/getting-started.md).

```bash
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
# Helm 2 command
helm install --name kubeapps --namespace kubeapps bitnami/kubeapps
# Helm 3 command
kubectl create namespace kubeapps
helm install kubeapps --namespace kubeapps bitnami/kubeapps --set useHelm3=true
``` 

## Developer Documentation

## Differences from Monocular

The [Monocular](https://github.com/helm/monocular) project was designed to run a public search and discovery website for Helm repositories (e.g. https://hub.kubeapps.com). Following its 1.0 release, Monocular is focused on delivering the experience for the Helm Hub.

Versions of Monocular 0.7 and older include a basic ability to install, view and delete Helm releases in a Kubernetes cluster. To focus on the Helm Hub experience, these [features have been removed](https://github.com/helm/monocular#looking-for-an-in-cluster-application-management-ui) since the 1.0 release and are no longer supported. We recommend users of Monocular's in-cluster features try Kubeapps as it provides a more featured, robust and secure solution to managing Helm applications in your cluster.
